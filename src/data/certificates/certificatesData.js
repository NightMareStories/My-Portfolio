                    As we all know, frameworks are now a mandatory requirement for almost every IT company. They provide fast, simple and collaborative work in the current IT decade. One of the most popular today is "React JS".
                </p>
                <p>
                    This course includes extended and detailed information on working with "React JS" in real conditions and on real tasks. In this course, I learned in depth the various tools and features of "React JS", such as: "working with JSX"; "creating components"; "routing and creation of SPA and MPA"; "events and functions"; "state and props"; "life cycle of components"; "refs and DOM"; "creating elements in React"; "hooks and working with them"; "redux store, reducers, action"; "redux toolkit"; "React in conjunction with PHP"; "React in conjunction with Node.js".
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the process of studying the course, I completed 123 or more practical tasks on the above topics, consolidating my knowledge and applying it to real projects. It was this course that showed me how frameworks, and in this case "React JS", are convenient and practical in application development, because it was on "React JS" using "redux" and "toolkit" that I created my portfolio site, on which you are now are.

                    The key role of any programming is working with arrays of data and objects. Any large project, any program, any application includes working with arrays and data objects, for example, the same "online store" or "personal account". Understanding the process of interaction of tools for working with arrays and objects is the very foundation that every developer needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, I learned the actual techniques for working with arrays and objects in "JavaScript", discovering a wide variety of tools and putting them into practice. This course covers the following topics: searching for values in an array - the "indexOf" method; array methods: "Includes"; array methods "push" and "pop"; methods "Shift", "Unshift", "Slice"; array method "Map"; "Filter" method; methods "Reduce", "isArray"; methods "Splice", "concat"; methods "Find," "FindIndex", "LastIndexOf"; methods "Sort", "Reverse"; methods "Split", "Join"; methods "Every", "Some"; methods "Flat", "Fill", "keys".
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, there are many tools for working with arrays and objects in "JavaScript", but it's worth considering that they all have their own scope, so you should always read the documentation for working with them. During this course, I completed all 120 tasks on these topics, working with each of these methods and honing my skills in working with arrays and objects.

                <p>
                    "OOP" it is a programming methodology based on the interaction of objects with each other, making it possible to inherit some properties and data from one object to another, change these properties, add new ones, etc. Due to this, when creating large projects, it is unnecessary to constantly create new data, write a huge amount of code, thereby making it unoptimized and difficult to read for everyone. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, I met and mastered the work of "OOP" in "JavaScript" using "prototypes", as well as the new "Class" syntax in "JavaScript ES6", and studied the following topics:
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    "What is OOP, myths and reality. OOP Whales : encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance"; "The concept of an object. Properties and methods. Prototype programming. Inheritance"; "Class, object, constructor. properties and methods. This"; "Inheritance using classes. Super, constructor"; "Magic methods get, set (getters and setters). The concept of private properties"; "Static properties and methods"; "This is a value in classes, objects, functions. Arrow functions and this. The concept of context"; "Explicitly specifying a context using call and apply. The bind method".
