# Hello!
&nbsp;

## This site - is my portfolio with projects, developments, and just my experience in front-end development. The site and it's content, will be updated as far as possible, time and effort.
&nbsp;

### The application is written in "React JS" using "React-Redux". "Node.js" (npm) was used to install the packages, you can download and install it "[here](https://nodejs.org/)".
### If you want to test the operation of the application, you need to install all the plugins from "package.json" with the command in your terminal.
&nbsp;

```

npm i

``` 

```

npm audit fix

```
&nbsp;

### Then start the entry point ("index.js") by entering this command in the terminal ("cmd" or other).
&nbsp;

```

npm start

```
&nbsp;

## **Let's get started!**

# 1. Introduction
&nbsp;

### "My-Portfolio" is a site with information about me, my projects and my development in web development. It contains blocks with a portfolio of projects and certificates, loading them from the "Redux" repository. Also on the page there are contact details and brief information about me.
&nbsp;

### The work of this site is to display data from the created "Redux" stores on the page in blocks with portfolios and certificates. When you select a project or certificate, a modal window is displayed with detailed information about it received from the repository. You can test any of my projects by clicking on the "Start App" button, or see its code and its description by clicking on the link to "GitHub".
&nbsp;

### In this project, I did not use any third-party sliders, modules and libraries, only "React JS", the "React-Redux" module and the "@reduxjs/toolkit' module for convenient creation of storage slices. The site is optimized and responsive for mobile devices.
